        <li>1/2 cup molasses</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>parchment paper</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Phew!</em> You may have to take a trip down to the local grocery store if you find yourself short on some ingredients</p>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F</li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bown, cream together the butter and 2 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, then stir in the water, orange juice, and molasses. Gradually stir the sifted ingredients into the molasses mixture</li>
        <li>Let sit for 45 minutes</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into walnut-sized balls, and roll them in the remaining 4 tablespoons of sugar (it's perfectly fine in you need more sugar to roll all dough balls)</li>
        <li>Place the cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet with parchment paper and flatten douch balls gently (<strong>NOT</strong> pancake flat).</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. *<em>COOKING TIME MAY BE LONGER DEPENDING ON YOUR OVEN</em>*</li>
        <li>Cookies will still be soft to the touch and will harden as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The cookie dough balls can be frozen abd baked later. The dough balls do not need to thaw before baking.</p>
